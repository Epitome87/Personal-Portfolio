              I'm Matthew McGrath, a long-time programmer beginning an exciting journey in web development. Since my
              first 'Hello, World' in high school, I have had an unbound curiosity for code and the problem-solving that
              accompanies it. With a strong pursuit for knowledge, I am perpetually improving my full-stack skills.
              Eager to tackle web development challenges with long-lasting impacts.
