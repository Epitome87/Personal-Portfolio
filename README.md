# Matthew McGrath's Personal Portfolio

## About This Project

This is my personal portfolio! Here I will showcase my skills and completed works as a game / web developer.

I will gradually add content to my portfolio until I finish my first design in its entirety. For my first design, I will go for a very minal, clean look. It will include only the bare essentials (a short introduction, a showcase of some projects, and a contact form). I wll avoid including anything too fancy, such as particle effects, 3D design aspects, and fancy transitions. I will, however, try to include a few micro-interactions.

My goal with a minimal design as my first draft is to both get the minimal-viable-product of the portfolio out as fast as possible, as well as to determine if a minimal look is actually the best approach. It is, afterall, a visually-pleasing design trend! I'm just a bit worried that not enough personality will shine through with such an approach, or not enough of my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills will be put into action.

## Design Process

My First Design - Minimalistic

Currently, I'm at the very early stages of my first design. So far, I think I've settled on a color scheme that I'd like not only for my portfolio, but to be associated with my "brand". These hex forms of these colors are:

```
#1E1E24 - Raising Black
#E05263 - Paradise Pink
#5F758E - Slate Gray
#E1DEE9 - Lavender Web
#2AF5FF (or maybe #477998 - Celadon Blue)
```

For my introduction section, I want simply a greeting, my name, and a few words on what I do. Perhaps a cartoon version of me will also sit beside my name. I believe it is best to avoid revealing ones appearance, age, race, etc, but I think a heavily stylized representation of me could be a good idea.

For my Projects section, I will showcase a small handful of the work I believe required the most time and mastery of multiple skills. (At this time, the amount of projects worth showing is rather small, so I need to tweak existing projects, flex them out to be production-grade, polish them, and finally host them!)

The final section will be a simple Contact form.

## Progress So Far

To begin, I must note that this is not a project I will work on _directly_ every day. Most of the work is in the actual acquiring of knowledge, skills, and completion of projects to showcase. I merely hope to have a completed "first draft" the same time that I finish my educational journey and showcase projects!

On 11/04/2021 I first sat down to design and code my portfolio. By day's end, I had the basic skeleton for the outline done, focusing on proper semantic HTML tags to represent each major section of content. I also had my (tentative) color scheme picked. I also implemented "snap" scrolling to each main section, but I have not finalized this yet, as I'm not sure it will lead to the best user experience in the end. Lastly, I have my sub-heading with my tagline / job role hooked up to a script which swaps different text in.
