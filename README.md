# Matthew McGrath's Personal Portfolio

## About This Project

This is my personal portfolio! Here I will showcase my skills and completed works as a web developer.

I will gradually add content to my portfolio until I finish my first design in its entirety. For my first design, I will go for a very minimal, clean look. It will include only the bare essentials (a short introduction, a showcase of some projects, and a contact form). I will avoid including anything too fancy, such as 3D design aspects or fancy transitions. I will, however, try to include a few micro-interactions.

My goal with a minimal design as my first draft is to both get the minimal-viable-product of the portfolio out as fast as possible, as well as to determine if a minimal look is actually the best approach. It is, after all, a visually-pleasing design trend! I'm just a bit worried that not enough personality will shine through with such an approach, or not enough of my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills will be put into action.

## Tools Used

Since I wanted to keep my portfolio simple and fast, I decided to use vanilla HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of JavaScript. Perhaps if I see the need for it, I will use React or Next.js in a future iteration.
